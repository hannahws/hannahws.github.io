        <h1>Lost & Found</h1>
        <h2>5th October</h2>
        

        <p>
            Welcome to Brackets, a modern open-source code editor that understands web design. It's a lightweight,
            yet powerful, code editor that blends visual tools into the editor so you get the right amount of help
            when you want it.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Concept</h2>
   
        <h3> 
           Lost & Found initiates discourse around the interpretation and relationship we have with the world around us. It is an exploration of the human condition through an innate loneliness found within the inanimate and the romantic ability to apply meaning to such. 

            Clothing as adornment and protection, an introspective engagement with obsolescent communication, and visual interpretation of atmosphere and space. 

            Perhaps an attempt to consolidate one’s self within the experience of absence of presence. 

            Garment as necessity
            Atmosphere without manifestation
            Communication without destination
        </h3>

        <p>
            In order to edit your own code using Brackets, you can just open the folder containing your files.
            Brackets treats the currently open folder as a "project"; features like Code Hints, Live Preview and
            Quick Edit only use files within the currently open folder.
        </p>
        
        <samp>
            Once you're ready to get out of this sample project and edit your own code, you can use the dropdown
            in the left sidebar to switch folders. Right now, the dropdown says "Getting Started" - that's the
            folder containing the file you're looking at right now. Click on the dropdown and choose "Open Folder…"
            to open your own folder.
            You can also use the dropdown later to switch back to folders you've opened previously, including this
            sample project.

        <h2>Exhibition</h2>
        <p>
            No more switching between documents and losing your context. When editing HTML, use the
            <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd> shortcut to open a quick inline editor that displays all the related CSS.
            Make a tweak to your CSS, hit <kbd>ESC</kbd> and you're back to editing HTML, or just leave the
            CSS rules open and they'll become part of your HTML editor. If you hit <kbd>ESC</kbd> outside of
            a quick inline editor, they'll all collapse. Quick Edit will also find rules defined in LESS and
            SCSS files, including nested rules.
        </p>
